            <p>Food For Thought is an interactive artwork which aims to raise awareness by exploring the causes and displaying the effects of food production and consumption. </p>   
            <p>The artwork is composed of two main parts; the input zone, and the projection. The input can be online or on-site.</p>
            <p>The visitors are invited to input one or more food ingredients they would normally use to make their recipe. When they do so, the projection image will start to deconstruct based on the sustainability of the ingredient. The deconstruction of the image is based on a scoring system, that each ingredient has. For example, red meat, which is in the top of this list, consumes more pixels from the image, while in contrast a material with a lower impact such as garlic consumes much fewer pixels. The scoring system considers two parameters, the carbon emissions of the ingredient based on the distance in which the material travels to reach London and the emissions throughout production. In our scoring system we have also included the water waste of each ingredient.</p>
