                    My name is Stathis and here are some of the works that I worked on during my MA in Computational Arts for the course of Creative Coding. As an artist I like to highlight societal issues. I am highly motivated to address humanitarian issues in which the most systemic channels of communication are buried. I believe that as individuals we must fight for a broader commitment to promoting social justice and human rights.

                    Prior to the MA, my practice was in between media and performance. Recently I started experimenting with computational media as a means of developing new forms of dramaturgy in my work. I have collaborated with various artists in creating works such as “Sans Attente” (2013), “Breathe” (2015), “Under Siege” (2016), “Matter” (2017), “in relation” (2016), “Reflections” (2017), “Silence” (2018) and “Pose_Transpose (2021). 
In parallel with my artistic practice, I work as a museum professional; I design and develop intuitive digital productions to foster visitors’ interactivity and enhance their experience.
